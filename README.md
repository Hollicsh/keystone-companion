Mythic score calculator undefined
The mythic score calculator is a tool that will help you know what keys you need to run next to get the achieved points/score you are after, Here is an example of how it works, if your rating is 2200, it could provide insights into which keys you need to run to reach 2500. To open the M+ score calculator press the calculator button inside the main frame or the mythic dungeon frame.
